Description: R bindings for the fsrs-rs Rust library implementing the Free 
    Spaced Repetition Scheduler (FSRS) algorithm. FSRS is a modern spaced 
    repetition algorithm based on the DSR (Difficulty, Stability, 
    Retrievability) model of memory. It uses 21 optimizable parameters to 
    predict optimal review intervals more accurately than traditional 
    algorithms like SM-2.
